i/p : echo "date" 
o/p : date

i/p : "`date`"
o/p : print the date

echo -n "hello" : no new line
To type out escape sequence - echo -e "hello\thi"
\b => backspace : Removes the previous letter
Limitations: We cannot use \b when the word goes to next line so use -n also
Eg: echo -n -e "hello\b"

To get the command helper:
man date: Gives the manual of the command.

To get the file: getid
Scripting File: We write all the commands in that file and we run as per our convinience.
