While cloning the VM click the option to:
reintialise the MAC Address of all the network cards : otherwise will have same Mac Address then difficulty in connectivity.

In virtualization: the host OS is the base OS.
In host-only mode - then Vms will the connectvity to each other but not to the internet.

In bridge mode- then Vms connected to each other as well as the internet. (limitation - outside wireless hub) (require DHCP technically.)
Vm network card will gte into the Bridging and go to the IP Addressing.
Both the VMs shoudl be in the same set-up.
The packet is 1st send to the Hotspot then the packet is transferred to the other VM.

To get the IP adress of the Vm then ifconfig esp0s3. 
Then ping both the PCs to check the conencivty status.
